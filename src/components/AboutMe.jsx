      <h2> About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a detail-oriented Computer Engineering graduate with a passion for
        software development and testing. My journey in the field of technology
        began at Zeal College Of Engineering And Research, where I honed my
        skills and acquired a strong foundation in Java, Python, SQL, and
        MongoDB. During my academic journey, I actively participated in
        extracurricular activities, serving as the Decoration Head at Zeal
        College of Engineering and Research. This role not only allowed me to
        showcase my leadership skills but also reinforced the importance of
        effective teamwork and collaboration. Driven by a commitment to
        excellence, I am eager to leverage my skills and experiences in a
        dynamic Test Engineer role, where I can ensure the quality and
        reliability of software products through manual testing and test
        automation. With a proactive approach to learning and a dedication to
        continuous improvement, I am ready to contribute to innovative projects
        and make a meaningful impact in the field of technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a keen interest in both backend and frontend development, I have
        explored various web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, React, and Rest
        API. My project experiences, including developing a Stock Market Price
        Prediction model using deep learning techniques and implementing an ATM
        Application using Java, have equipped me with hands-on experience in
        software development and problem-solving.
